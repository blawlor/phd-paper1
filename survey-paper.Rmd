abstract: In this paper we survey bioinformatics practicioners' familiarity with, and attitude towards, the infrastructure, processes and practices that are currently considered standard in software engineering practice. We use this as a measure of the extent to which software engineering values prevail in bioinformatics contexts. The generally held opinion that such values are lacking is supported by the results. Other authors make a special case for the difficulty of applying good software engineering values to bioinformatics in particular or to scientific software development in general. However we argue that there is no such special case, and propose instead how lessons from industry might best be applied to scientific and academic settings.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
